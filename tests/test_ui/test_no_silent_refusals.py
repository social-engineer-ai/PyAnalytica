"""A button must never do nothing without saying why.

Three separate people reported the same bug in three different modules --
Correlate with one column, then Cluster, then Reduce -- and the cause was
identical each time: ``req()`` inside a handler fired by a button press. It
aborts the render silently, so the student sees no chart, no message and no
error. The button looks broken.

Browser tests could not catch this class of bug, because every one of them
selected valid inputs first: they exercised the path that works. So this is a
source-level rule instead, which holds for modules nobody has written a browser
test for yet.

The rule
--------

``req()`` is right in a render that has nothing to show *yet* -- before the
first run, an empty region is honest. It is wrong once the student has acted.
So: any function decorated with ``@reactive.event`` must route its ``req()``
calls through ``require()``, which shows the reason before giving up.

If this test fails, the fix is not to add an exemption. It is to write the
sentence the student needs to read.
