"""Updating a select input without losing what the user chose.

``ui.update_select(id, choices=...)`` with no ``selected`` resets the input to
the first choice. Every module refreshes its dropdowns whenever the active
dataset changes, so the pattern is everywhere, and it produces two distinct
faults:

* **The selection jumps.** A student picks a column, something unrelated
  refreshes the list, and they are silently moved to whichever option sorts
  first. This is how loading a second dataset used to move a student's work
  from ``tips`` to ``diamonds``.

* **The selection goes stale.** Between the list changing and the reset
  landing, the input still holds the old value -- which may not exist in the
  new data. A tester merging ``titanic`` with ``regions`` got
  ``KeyError: ['carat'] not in index``: ``carat`` is a *diamonds* column, left
  over from an earlier pairing.

:func:`update_choices` keeps the current value when it is still offered, and
otherwise falls back deliberately rather than by accident.
