"""Recognising date columns when a file is loaded.

A CSV has no types. A `date` column arrives as text, classifies as TEXT, and
Timeline then has nothing to offer as a date axis — a tester loaded a file with
365 days of dates and Profile called the column `str`.

The temptation is to hand every text column to ``pd.to_datetime`` and keep
whatever sticks. That is how an order reference like ``2024-001`` silently
becomes the 1st of January 2024, and nobody notices until a chart is wrong.
So the rule here is deliberately narrow:

1. Only object/string columns are considered. Numbers are never reinterpreted,
   so ``20240115`` stays an integer even though it looks like a date.
2. The values must *look* like dates before pandas is asked — a strict pattern
   match, not a guess. ``2024-001`` does not match; ``2024-01-05`` does.
3. Nearly all the values must convert. One stray word is tolerated; a column
   that is half dates and half something else is left alone.
4. What was converted is reported, so the student sees it happened and can
   change it back in Transform.

Ambiguity is unavoidable with ``05/06/2024`` and is resolved month-first, the
pandas default. The generated code says so, so a student reading it can see
the assumption rather than inherit it silently.
